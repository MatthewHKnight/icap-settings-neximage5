Info:

These settings might not be perfect for all area's but should give you some where to start.
You will possibly need to just adjust the gain / exposure.


How to Use:
1. Start up iCap or IC Capture.
2. Click the Celestron NexImage 5 camera.
3. After iCape / IC Capture have been loaded...
4. Click file, Load Configuration.
5. Locate where you put the settings folder that is inside the ZIP
6. And setting for which planet you're gonna image.
7. Adjust the recording size in the middle should be under near the magnifying glass you will left of the FPS 
8. Adjust the Gain / Exposure.

You might need to click on view / toolbar to enable the other size ect..

[Important]: You will need to change the Video file path it's under the FPS sure possibly see Video file.
